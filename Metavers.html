<pre id="sec2" class="x2"><h2>How does the metaverse work?</h2></pre>
<pre class="x3">The way the metaverse will work is still being defined. But it will probably provide users with 
a single avatar or digital identity, which grants them access to an integrated digital ecosystem. 

The ecosystem would potentially have its own currency, property and possessions. 
This could be a digitally altered form of reality, a virtual world built from scratch, or some combination of the two.

Within this metaverse, users may ultimately be able to perform all the online tasks that are currently spread
across separate digital properties like websites and apps, ideally without the need for the many passwords 

and user accounts that characterize current digital experiences. Chinese apps (or ‘super-apps’) 
as WeChat already have significant interoperability, integrating a discussion platforms
    
Meanwhile the gaming community may argue a game such as Fortnite qualifies as a kind of prototype metaverse
The game boasts 350 million registered users globally (a population equal to the US)
and includes in-game currency that can be earned and traded.

While the building blocks exist, they are not yet connected into a true metaverse.
Our assumptions are based on existing knowledge and behaviour. Many predictions may come true,

but other possible paths will fail or simply not be taken up by developers and users as technology grows 
and people adapt to and help shape its possibilities.

    <pre class="x5">is not yet possible to access a complete metaverse. But how we access the metaverse 
    in the future will be a crucial influence on its development.
 Will it become an open access tool of opportunity or a closed access,more commercial enterprise?

Currently users access the digital world via screens, whether mobile or desktop devices.
A metaverse will be accessed via easily portable and immersive hardware like headsets, gloves, watches and contact lenses.
hear and touch a digital landscape directly,as opposed to via a projection on a screen.
        
This hardware will, however, also allow the metaverse more direct access to its users.
It will be increasingly easy for sophisticated algorithms to collect far more complex, dynamic data on users.

This would include heart rate, pupil dilation,while users will be granted greater access to a digital world through a metaverse,
providers of goods and services will have an even more intrusive insight into their users’ beliefs, fears and desires.
        
Existing information such as likes, clicks and shares are already used by platform providers
to shape our experience online, sell us goods and services and share information about us with other companies.

The temptation to put users under even more constant and detailed surveillance 
will be hard to resist in a metaverse founded on profit-driven motives .

 <pre class="n1">Will it become an open access tool of opportunity

<pre class="n2">As no fully fledged metaverse currently exists, it is not possible to say that there are any ‘owners’ as such.
However, major technology companies are positioning themselves to serve as portals (or gateways) to the metaverse.
Each seeks to offer the preeminent,if not the only, point of entry.

Meta has invested $10 billion in its metaverse work already, after purchasing virtual reality firm Oculus Vision Tech in 2014.
It and other major companies such as Walmart  

and Nike are busy filing trademark protection and copyright on virtual versions of their products in preparation for the metaverse.
It is likely these big companies will try to achieve dominance in the metaverse and guard their intellectual property.
But their unchallenged monopoly would create serious problems.

   <pre id="sec4" class="x7"> Regulation of the metaverse:</pre>

   <pre class="x8"> Regulation of the metaverse presents a real challenge – not least because it is not yet clear exactly what
form the metaverse will take.

But governments, the private sector, international organizations, and civil society need to anticipate rapid technological advances.
These sectors should work together to provide 

a regulatory structure built on an informed, international, democratic consensus as opposed to corporate priorities alone.
Regulation needs to consider a range of human rights and legal issues,
 
from the level of monitoring, data collection and oblique advertising permitted,
to the protection of vulnerable people including children.

There are also more technical issues such as contractual terms, intellectual property,
content licensing and ownership and trading of digital assets.

<pre id="sec5" class="x9"> How will the metaverse change the world?</pre>
<pre class="z"> the internet, the metaverse could deliver enormous benefits in some areas.
But it could also dramatically amplify existing societal problems.

Internet surveillance by governments and corporations already infringes on civil liberties, human agency and privacy.
Social media feeds polarization by spreading disinformation and sheltering users from alternate views. 

Under the surveillance capitalism model, platforms pass user data to other companies 
so that they can specifically target those users, whether with products or ideas.

Often users are unaware that their data is being gathered or sold on,
or that they are being targeted with particular products or news as a result. 

This online manipulation interferes with our freedom of thought 
and encourages polarization of views, and greater distrust in sources of information.

<pre id="sec6" class="z1"> What are the benefits of the metaverse?</pre>
<pre class="z2">The metaverse could bring new advances in all areas of society, beyond gaming to healthcare,
education, commerce and creative industries.

For example, much like the internet, the metaverse offers the chance to facilitate the sharing of knowledge. 
Algorithms could be designed to learn from children’s behaviour

discovering how to create more effective learning spaces and teaching styles,both online and in reality,
 Children could also learn in a more interactive, less passive way.
    
The metaverse will also create exciting new possibilities for leisure and creative expression,
allowing users to shape their own unique worlds, or to redesign the real one, decorating 
it with digital art and populating it with digital creatures.      
</pre>
<br>
<br>
    <pre id="sec7" class="z3">Are there any issues with the metaverse? </pre>
        <pre class="z4">Probably the greatest issue with the metaverse is that its development is being entirely led by commercial interests.
There is very little public debate about how our future digital environment should look, who should design it.
what its purpose should be and what standards should govern its operation.

In addition to the human rights risks flagged earlier, there will be other potential risks to society arising from a metaverse.
The metaverse threatens to increase digital exclusion, 
if people around the world have unequal access to the technologies essential to metaverse participation.
