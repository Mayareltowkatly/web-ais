      <pre id="sec1" class="s"> What Is Robotics?</pre>

      <pre class="s1" >
        Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines,
        called robots, that replicate or substitute for human actions. Pop culture has always been fascinated with robots

        examples: include R2-D2, the Terminator and WALL-E. These over-exaggerated, humanoid concepts of robots usually seem,
        and mechanical capabilities that don’t put the possibility of a R2-D2-like machine out of reach in the future.
        
        As technology progresses, so too does the scope of what is considered robotics. In 2005,
        90 percent of all robots could be found assembling cars in automotive factories. 
         
        These robots consist mainly of mechanical arms tasked with welding or screwing on certain parts of a car. 
        Today, were seeing an evolved and expanded definition of robotics that includes the development,
        Humanoid robots are robots that look like or mimic human behavior.
        
        These robots usually perform human-like activities (like running, jumping and carrying objects),
        and are sometimes designed to look like us,

       <pre id="sec2" class="s2">Autonomous Robots :</pre>
      
       <pre class="s3">
        
        Autonomous robots operate independently of human operators. 
        These robots are usually designed to carry out tasks in open environments that do not require human supervision.
        They are quite unique because they use sensors to perceive the world around them,
        and then employ decision-making structures
         
        (usually a computer) to take the optimal next step based on their data and mission.
        One example of an autonomous robot is the Roomba vacuum cleaner, which uses sensors to roam freely throughout a home.

        <pre id="sec3" class="xx">EXAMPLES OF AUTONOMOUS :</pre>
        <pre class="x1">
        Teleoperated Robots
        Teleoperated robots are semi-autonomous
        bots that use a wireless network to enable human control from a safe distance.
        These robots usually work in extreme geographical conditions, weather and circumstances.
        </pre>
          <pre class="xxx">Examples of teleoperated:</pre>
          <pre class="x2">
        robots are the human-controlled submarines used to fix underwater pipe leaks during 
        the BP oil spill or drones used to detect landmines on a battlefield.

       <pre class="s4">What Is a Bot? What Is Software Robotics?</pre>
        <pre class="s5">
        Software robotics, also called bots, are computer programs which carry out tasks autonomously.
        One common use case of software robots is a chatbot. 
        
        A chatbot is a computer program that simulates conversation both online 
        and over the phone and is often used in customer service scenarios, 
        
        oftware robots only exist on the internet and originate within a computer, which means they are not considered robots
        In order to be considered a robot, a device must have a physical form, such as a body or a chassis.(AGI)

        <pre id="sec5" class="s7">What Are the Main Components of a Robot?</pre>
       <pre class="s8">
        Robots are built to present solutions to a variety of needs and fulfill several different purposes,
         and therefore, require a variety of specialized components to complete these tasks.
        
        However, there are several components that are central to every robots construction, 
        like a power source or a central processing unit. Generally speaking, robotics components fall into these five categories:
       </pre> 
       
        <pre class="c1">Sensors :</pre>
        <pre class="c2">
        Sensors provide a robot with stimuli in the form of electrical signals that are processed
         by the controller and allow the robot to interact with the outside world.
         
         Common sensors found within robots include video cameras that function as eyes,
          photoresistors that react to light and microphones that operate like ears.
          
          These sensors allow the robot to capture its surroundings and process the most logical conclusion based
           on the current moment and allows the controller to relay commands to the additional components.
      </pre>
      <br>
        <pre class="c3">Actuators :</pre>
        <pre class="c4">
        A device can only be considered to be a robot if it has a movable frame or body
        Actuators are the components that are responsible for this movement.
        
        These components are made up of motors that receive signals from the control system and move in tandem to carry out
         the movement necessary to complete the assigned task.
         </pre>
      <br>
      
       <pre class="c5">Power Supply :</pre>
        <pre class="c6">
        Like the human body requires food in order to function, robots require power.
        Stationary robots, such as those found in a factory, may run on AC power through a wall outlet but more commonly
         robots operate via an internal battery. Most robots utilize lead-acid batteries for their safe qualities 

         and long shelf life while others may utilize the more compact but also more expensive silver-cadmium variety.
          Safety, weight, replaceability and lifecycle are all important factors to consider when designing a robot’s power supply.
        </pre>
        <br>
        <pre class="c7">End Effectors :</pre>
        <pre class="c8">
        End effectors are the physical, typically external components that allow robots to finish carrying out their tasks.
        Robots in factories often have interchangeable tools like paint sprayers and drills,
         
        surgical robots may be equipped with scalpels and other kinds of robots can be built with gripping claws
        or even hands for tasks like deliveries, packing, bomb diffusion and much more.

       <pre class="cc">
        Robots have a wide variety of use cases that make them the ideal technology for the future
        Soon, we will see robots almost everywhere. We’ll see them in hospitals, hotels and even on roads.
      </pre>
        
        
       <pre id="sec6" class="c" >Robotics in Manufacturing</pre>
       <pre class="cc1">
        The manufacturing industry is probably the oldest and most well-known user of robots.
         These robots and co-bots (bots that work alongside humans) work to efficiently test and assemble products, 
         like cars and industrial equipment. It’s estimated that there are more than three million industrial robots in use right now.

        <pre class="cc2">Logistics Robots</pre>
        <pre class="cc3">
        Shipping, handling and quality control robots are becoming a must-have for most retailers and logistics companies.
        Because we now expect our packages to arrive at blazing speeds, logistics companies employ robots in warehouses, 

         and even on the road, to help maximize time efficiency. Right now, there are robots taking your items off the shelves, 
         ensure that you’ll have a face-to-metal-face encounter with a logistics bot in the near future.

        <br>
        <pre class="cc4">Robots for Home</pre>
        <pre class="cc5">
        Its not science fiction anymore. Robots can be seen all over our homes, helping with chores,
         reminding us of our schedules and even entertaining our kids. 
         
         Additionally, robots have now evolved to do everything from autonomously mowing grass to cleaning pools.
        The most well-known example of home robots is the autonomous vacuum cleaner Roomba.

        Is there anything more science fiction-like than autonomous vehicles?
        These self-driving cars are no longer just imagination. A combination of data science and robotics,
        self-driving vehicles are taking the world by storm. Companies like Tesla, Ford, Waymo, Volkswagen 

        and BMW are all working on the next wave of travel that will let us sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.
        Rideshare companies Uber and Lyft are also developing autonomous rideshare vehicles 
        that don’t require humans to operate the vehicle.

        <pre class="cc9">
        Robots have made enormous strides in the healthcare industry.
         These mechanical marvels have use in just about every aspect of healthcare, 
         from robot-assisted surgeries to bots that help humans recover from injury in physical therapy.

        Examples : of robots at work in healthcare are Toyota’s healthcare assistants,
         which help people regain the ability to walk,

        and TUG, a robot designed to autonomously stroll throughout a hospital and deliver everything 
        from medicines to clean linens.

       <pre id="sec7" class="k"> History of Robotics</pre>
       <pre class="k1">
        People have been pondering robots since ancient civilizations incorporated myths and beliefs
        of “thinking machines” into their societies and invented the water clock.
